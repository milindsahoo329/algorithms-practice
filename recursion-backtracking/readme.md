# Recursion & Backtracking

## Basics

A recursive function should have the following properties so that it does not result in an infinite loop -

1. A simple base case (or cases) â€” a terminating scenario that does not use recursion to produce an answer.
2. A set of rules, also known as recurrence relation that reduces all other cases towards the base case

### Tasks done

```java
Recursively print reverse of a string
Recursively reverse a character array without extra memory
```

## Recurrence Relations

There are two important things that one needs to figure out before implementing a recursive function -

1. Recurrence relation: the relationship between the result of a problem and the result of its subproblems.

2. Base case: the case where one can compute the answer directly without any further recursion calls. 

Once we figure out the above two elements, to implement a recursive function we simply call the function itself according to the recurrence relation until we reach the base case.

```java
Recursively print pascals triangle
Iteratively print pascals triangle
```
